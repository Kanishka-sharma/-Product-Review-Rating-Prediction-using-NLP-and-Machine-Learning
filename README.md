# ⭐ Product Review Rating Prediction using NLP and Machine Learning

## 📘 Project Overview

This project focuses on building machine learning models capable of predicting product ratings based solely on the written text of user reviews. The goal is to develop a predictive system that analyzes review content and estimates how users rated the product on a scale from 1 to 5.

By applying Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and supervised learning models, the project explores how review sentiment and content can be used to infer user satisfaction.

## 🎯 Objective

- Preprocess and analyze a dataset of product reviews.
- Train machine learning models to predict product ratings (1–5) based on review text.
- Evaluate and compare the performance of different models.
- Justify modeling decisions through experimentation and result interpretation.

---

## 📂 Dataset

The dataset used is `dataset.csv`, which contains product reviews collected from Amazon.

### 📄 Format

- CSV (comma-separated)

### 🧾 Columns

| Column | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `Score` | Rating score (one of: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) |
| `Text`  | Textual content of the product review |

## ⚙️ Approach

1. **Text Preprocessing**
   - Tokenization
   - Stop word removal
   - Lemmatization
   - Text normalization (lowercasing, punctuation removal, etc.)

2. **Feature Extraction**
   - TF-IDF vectorization
   - Word embeddings (optional)

3. **Model Training**
   - Baseline models (Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes)
   - Advanced models (Random Forest, SVM, or LSTM/BERT for experimentation)

4. **Evaluation**
   - Metrics: Accuracy, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix
   - Cross-validation and model tuning

## 💡 Insights

This project highlights how NLP and machine learning can be used to extract valuable information from unstructured textual data. By mapping the sentiment and language of user reviews to a numerical score, it's possible to automate rating predictions and support applications like review moderation, customer feedback analysis, and product recommendation systems.
